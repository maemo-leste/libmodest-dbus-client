modest
------

"modest" is a modest e-mail program, based on Philip van Hoof's *tinymail*.
tinymail is an effort to ease the writing of email programs, in particular
for small devices.

And while tinymail can support just about anything, we are using it's 
*libcamel* backend for mail protocol implementation.
